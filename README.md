# Unsplash Images Downloader - Python3
## _Works as of 15-Mar-2021_

I wanted to create a Python project to learn the language.
I also wanted to grab high quality images for free from Unsplash

So I wrote this script

## Features

- It uses Python
- It's self explanatory to use - the comments are in the code
- It opens an Unsplash URL in a selenium based browser.
- It automatically scrolls down so the images lazyload in the browser
- It downloads a 1920x1080 (ish) based image for each of the image thumbnails shown in the browser
- Simples :)
